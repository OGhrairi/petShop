# petShop - Object Oriented Programming Coursework
This is a piece of coursework from my first year of Computer Science, in which we were tasked with creating a stock management program
for a pet shop (because of course what better way to teach object orientation than by using animal taxonomy).

The program allows for the user to add animals to their stock (either through the single entry form, or reading a list of animals from an external
file), sell a given animal, write a list of current animals in stock to a file, search the stock for an animal based on various criteria,
or compute company revenue based on bought/sold animals.

The UI is pretty rough (both because this was my first project that wasn't web based, and stock Java UI tools are god awful), but everything
is functional, and it got a good grade, so it can't be that bad.

Included in the files here are a compiled .jar, and my design report as well as a class diagram explaining the heirarchy for the animal
taxonomy.
